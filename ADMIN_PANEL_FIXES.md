# Admin Panel Fixes - Books & Files Management

**Date**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and Ready to Deploy

---

## Problems Fixed

### Problem 1: Cannot Create New Books
**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Create book error: Error: Book validation failed: bookId: Path `bookId` is required.
```

**Cause:** When creating a new book, the `bookId` field was not being generated automatically.

**Fix:** Added auto-generation of `bookId` in [server/routes/admin.js:363-365](server/routes/admin.js#L363-L365):
```javascript
// Generate bookId automatically
const lastBook = await Book.findOne().sort({ bookId: -1 }).limit(1);
const nextBookId = lastBook ? lastBook.bookId + 1 : 1;

const bookData = {
  ...req.body,
  bookId: nextBookId
};
```

### Problem 2: Cannot Delete Files When Editing Books
**Issue:** When editing a book and trying to replace the cover image or PDF file, the old file deletion would fail, causing the old file to persist.

**Cause:**
1. Frontend sends full URLs: `https://mubarakway-backend.onrender.com/uploads/covers/file.jpg`
2. Backend expected relative URLs: `/uploads/covers/file.jpg`
3. File deletion logic couldn't extract the path correctly

**Fix:** Updated [server/routes/upload.js:165-231](server/routes/upload.js#L165-L231):
```javascript
// Support both full URLs and relative paths
let relativePath = fileUrl;

if (fileUrl.startsWith('http://') || fileUrl.startsWith('https://')) {
  const url = new URL(fileUrl);
  relativePath = url.pathname;
  console.log('üîó Extracted path from URL:', relativePath);
}

const filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', relativePath);
```

### Problem 3: Inconsistent File URLs
**Issue:** Uploaded files returned relative URLs, but the system needed full URLs for consistency.

**Fix:** Updated file upload to return full URLs ([server/routes/upload.js:139-157](server/routes/upload.js#L139-L157)):
```javascript
// Return full URL with domain
const baseUrl = process.env.BACKEND_URL || `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT || 3001}`;
const fullUrl = `${baseUrl}${relativePath}`;

res.json({
  success: true,
  file: {
    filename: req.file.filename,
    originalName: req.file.originalname,
    url: fullUrl,  // Full URL with domain
    relativePath: relativePath,  // For compatibility
    size: req.file.size,
    mimetype: req.file.mimetype
  }
});
```

### Problem 4: JWT Token Mismatch
**Issue:** `admin.js` and `upload.js` used different default JWT secrets, causing token verification to fail.

**Fix:** Synchronized JWT_SECRET across both files:
- `admin.js`: `mubarakway-admin-secret-2025`
- `upload.js`: `mubarakway-admin-secret-2025` (was `mubarakway-secret-key-2025`)

## Required Environment Variables on Render.com

You need to add these environment variables to your Render.com backend service:

### 1. BACKEND_URL
```
BACKEND_URL=https://mubarakway-backend.onrender.com
```
**Purpose:** Used to generate full URLs for uploaded files

### 2. JWT_SECRET
```
JWT_SECRET=mubarakway-admin-jwt-secret-2025-production-key
```
**Purpose:** Secret key for signing and verifying admin JWT tokens

### How to Add on Render.com:

1. Go to Render.com Dashboard
2. Select **mubarakway-backend** service
3. Click **Environment** tab
4. Click **Add Environment Variable**
5. Add both variables:
   - Key: `BACKEND_URL`, Value: `https://mubarakway-backend.onrender.com`
   - Key: `JWT_SECRET`, Value: `mubarakway-admin-jwt-secret-2025-production-key`
6. Click **Save Changes**
7. Render will automatically redeploy the service

## Files Modified

### 1. server/routes/admin.js
**Lines 351-392** - POST /api/admin/books (Create book):
```javascript
// Generate bookId automatically
const lastBook = await Book.findOne().sort({ bookId: -1 }).limit(1);
const nextBookId = lastBook ? lastBook.bookId + 1 : 1;

console.log(`üî¢ Generated bookId: ${nextBookId}`);

const bookData = {
  ...req.body,
  bookId: nextBookId
};
```

### 2. server/routes/upload.js
**Lines 107-108** - Synchronized JWT_SECRET:
```javascript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'mubarakway-admin-secret-2025';
```

**Lines 139-157** - Return full URLs:
```javascript
const baseUrl = process.env.BACKEND_URL || `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT || 3001}`;
const fullUrl = `${baseUrl}${relativePath}`;
```

**Lines 165-231** - Enhanced file deletion:
```javascript
// Support both relative and absolute URLs
let relativePath = fileUrl;

if (fileUrl.startsWith('http://') || fileUrl.startsWith('https://')) {
  const url = new URL(fileUrl);
  relativePath = url.pathname;
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Book Creation Flow:
1. Admin fills book form ‚Üí Frontend sends to POST /api/admin/books
2. Backend generates `bookId` automatically (finds highest + 1)
3. Book saves to MongoDB with `bookId`
4. ‚úÖ Success response returned

### File Upload Flow:
1. Admin selects file ‚Üí Frontend sends to POST /api/upload
2. Multer saves file to `uploads/{category}/` directory
3. Backend returns full URL: `https://mubarakway-backend.onrender.com/uploads/covers/file.jpg`
4. Frontend stores full URL in form

### File Deletion Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Delete" on file ‚Üí Frontend sends DELETE /api/upload with full URL
2. Backend extracts pathname: `/uploads/covers/file.jpg`
3. Backend constructs full path: `server/uploads/covers/file.jpg`
4. File deleted from disk
5. ‚úÖ Success response returned

### File Replacement Flow:
1. Admin uploads new file ‚Üí Old file URL sent to DELETE endpoint
2. Old file deleted successfully
3. New file uploaded ‚Üí New URL returned
4. Form updated with new URL
5. Book/Nashid updated with new file URL
